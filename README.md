# Enumeration and Priviledge escalation Lab

<p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
In this laboratory session, we will utilize tools available in Kali Linux, such as nmap, to perform a comprehensive enumeration of a designated target system. Through this process, we aim to identify vulnerabilities within the target system's infrastructure and subsequently exploit these vulnerabilities to establish a foothold. Furthermore, we will explore techniques to escalate our privileges within the target system, ultimately seeking to attain root access.
